License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE
 BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE
 CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE
 IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
    a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or
    encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
    with one or more other contributions, constituting separate and independent
    works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that
    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
    dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording,
    art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the
    Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
    musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a
    Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
    c. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offers the Work under the terms of this License.
    d. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    who created the Work.
    e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms
    of this License.
    f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
    the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or
 restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on
 the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
 hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
 duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the
 Work as stated below:
 .
    a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collective Works;
    b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
    Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
    steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were
    made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification
    could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
    c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the
    Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
    d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
    publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission
    Derivative Works.
    e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
          1. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event that
          Licensor is a member of a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI,
          SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public performance or
          public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
          2. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
          exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights
          agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any
          phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute,
          subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the
          US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
    6. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt,
    where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to
    collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g.
    SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
    of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114
    of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
 hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such
 modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other
 media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
 reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
    a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You
    must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License
    with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
    publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability
    of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
    warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work
    from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
    Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from
    the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
    create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
    extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required
    by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice
    from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
    2. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative
    Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in
    Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide,
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if
    the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.
    a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
    ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or
    by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of
    the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform
    Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with
    the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
    licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b) in the
    case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author,"
    or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
    required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work,
    at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of
    these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
    credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner
    set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
    implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
 THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK
 BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR
 OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
 NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
 LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
    a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as defined in
    Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from
    You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
    provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those
    licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, b, and 8 will survive any termination of this
    License.
    c. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
